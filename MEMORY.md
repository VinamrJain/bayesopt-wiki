# MEMORY

Project ops and in-progress work. Wiki build handoff: `~/.claude/handoffs/Bayesian-Optimization-2026-06-03-wiki-build.md`.

## Doc roles

| File | Audience | Content |
|------|----------|---------|
| `references.md` | Anyone | Bibliography: keys, authors, links, one-paragraph contribution. **No** agent tiers, parse status, or session jargon. |
| `MEMORY.md` | Agents | Project ops: doc roles, git, sources, context-rot. **Not** the build plan. |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Agents | Repo conventions. |
| `wiki/map.md` | Agents + humans | The index: concept registry, prerequisite graph, learning tracks, planned concepts. **Authoritative for routing and per-note source coverage.** |
| `site/` | Humans + agents | Astro site publishing the wiki (interactive graph, note pages, tracks). `site/README.md` = architecture + deploy. Reads `wiki/*.md`; never writes notes. |

Writing style: same bar as `~/.claude/memory/feedback_skill-writing-generic.md` and concept-wiki pattern in `~/.claude/memory/reference_concept-wiki-synthesis.md`.

## Git

Remote: `origin` → `github.com/VinamrJain/bayesopt-wiki` (GitHub Pages target). Atomic commits; prefixes `wiki:` `raw:` `fix:` `chore:` `site:` `docs:` `ci:`. Undo with `git revert`, not `reset --hard`. Stage paths explicitly. No secrets (`.env`); don't push unless asked.

**Deploy flow:** push to `main` triggers `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`, which builds the Astro site from `site/` (`npm ci && npm run build` → astro + Pagefind) and publishes `site/dist` to GitHub Pages at <https://vinamrjain.github.io/bayesopt-wiki/>. The project-page base (`BASE_PATH=/bayesopt-wiki/`, `SITE_URL`) is set in the workflow env. Pages source must be set to "GitHub Actions" in repo settings.

Tracks: `raw/**/*.tex`, `raw/**/*.bib`, trustworthy `raw/**/*.md`; plus `references.md`, `wiki/`, and `scripts/`. Ignores OS/editor cruft, Python caches, secrets, PDFs, and `_archive/` — see `.gitignore`.

Background sessions: bg-isolation guard disabled via `.claude/settings.json` (`worktree.bgIsolation: none`) so doc edits land in the main checkout. Read at session start — fresh session honors it, mid-session toggling does not.

## Sources

Truth: `raw/` — LaTeX via `scripts/fetch_arxiv_sources.py`, or `raw/<key>/<key>.md` for pdf-derived papers (YAML: `source_type: pdf-derived`, `parser: mathpix`). `_archive/` drafts are **not** sources.

Local PDFs under `raw/<key>/` are gitignored; commit only good `.md`.

## Context rot

Model quality degrades once a session exceeds ~**120–150k tokens**: notation drifts, concepts get defined twice, proofs merge incorrectly across papers.

**Mitigations:** writer subagents read heavy sources in their own context; the lead session accumulates only finished notes + reconciliation; **≤~90k loaded docs** per session; handoff at batch boundaries; resume from handoff + git, not chat history. Never load all of `raw/` in one session (~590k tokens total corpus).

## Site (`site/`)
Interactive Astro static site that publishes the wiki: a D3 force-directed prerequisite graph,
KaTeX-rendered note pages, learning tracks, full-text search (Pagefind), and a bibliography. Live at
<https://vinamrjain.github.io/bayesopt-wiki/>; pushing `main` redeploys via GitHub Actions. `wiki/*.md`
stays the single source of truth — the site reads frontmatter + `[[wikilinks]]` at build, never writes
notes. Run locally with `cd site && pixi run dev`; search needs a real build (`pixi run build &&
pixi run preview`), not dev. See `site/README.md` for architecture/deploy.
- **Adding a note is self-contained:** write `wiki/<slug>.md` with valid frontmatter and the page,
  graph node, edges, backlinks, ToC, and search entry all derive automatically. The node color comes
  from the `subtopic` frontmatter field — no code edit. The only optional curation is adding the slug
  to a learning track in `site/src/lib/tracks.ts` (reading order is editorial, kept centralized).
- The `notation` note is intentionally hidden from the visual graph (a reference note with no prereq
  edges) via `visualGraph()` in `site/src/lib/graph.ts`; it remains a reachable note page.

## Wiki build — status

Routing and per-note source coverage live in **`wiki/map.md`** (the index). The synthesis
mandate moved into `wiki/CONVENTIONS.md`; the conceptual review pass is the `wiki-reflection`
skill. The original build plan (note map, routing table, model rules, session batches) is
retired to `_archive/source-routing.md` as a historical record.

**Progress:** Tier 0 + Tier 1 + S2 + S3a + S3b done.
- S0a ✅ `3b7289c` — `CONVENTIONS.md`, `notation.md`, `gaussian-process-regression.md`, `expected-improvement.md` (exemplar).
- S0b ✅ `6f1a60b` — `problem-setup`, `gp-hyperparameters`.
- S1a ✅ `b3513b0` — `acquisition-functions` (hub), `probability-of-improvement`, `gp-ucb`, `thompson-sampling-bo`.
- S1b ✅ `54a8c85` — `value-of-information`, `knowledge-gradient` (coupled; shared VoI frame).
- S1c ✅ `c71077e` — `entropy-search`, `predictive-entropy-search`, `max-value-entropy-search`
  (ES-frame relayed to PES/MES; promoted `p_⋆`, `γ_T`, `δ` to notation.md; trimmed gp-ucb delta).
- S2 ✅ `21cdb5e` — `bo-as-dynamic-program` (lead-authored). Terminal-reward Bellman recursion
  matching the VoI/KG seam; truncation table (EI/noisy-EI/KG/ES/PES/MES ← terminal utilities `u`);
  lam2016 stage-reward form reconciled (telescoping, `E[r_n]=EI`, `γ` = myopic↔multi-step dial).
  No new promotions (S2-local `S^n`/`V^n`/`π` kept as delta; revisit at S6 if shared by ≥3).

- S3a ✅ `13310c0` — `cost-aware-bo` (hub), `ei-per-unit-cost`, `cost-cooling-carbo`, `cost-models`.
  Promoted cost symbols (`c`,`log c`,`τ`,`τ_init`,`τ_k`,`α_k`,`EIpu`,`EI-cool`) to notation.md;
  `α_k` disambiguated from generic `α_n(x)`. Hub reconciles **two** cost-aware problem
  formulations: budget-constrained (lee2020) vs cost-per-sample/cost-adjusted-regret (xie2025);
  family map covers EIpu / cost-cooling / PBGI-LogEIPC-stopping. EI-cool schedule re-derived
  against lee2020 source line.

- S3b ✅ `fe32098` (notes) / `9079869` (xie2024 source) — `budget-constrained-dp`,
  `multistep-budgeted-bo`, `nonmyopic-cost-constrained-bo`, `cost-aware-stopping`, **+
  `pandoras-box-gittins-index`** (PBGI split out as its own acquisition note — **5** notes, not the
  routed 4; user-approved). Lead-authored; connects to S2 (`V^n`/`V^{π,n}` rollout seam).
  **Notation:** resolved `τ` overload — `τ`=hard budget; new **`T`**=adaptive stopping time,
  **`N_B`**=random budget-depletion horizon, **`B`**=expected budget. **Ingested `xie2024`**
  (arXiv 2406.20062, Pandora's-Box Gittins Index): the true origin of PBGI/LogEIPC — S3a had
  mis-attributed them to `xie2025`; re-attributed across `cost-aware-stopping`/`ei-per-unit-cost`/
  `cost-aware-bo`. Fixed `snoek2012` missing from `cost-aware-bo` `sources:`. astudillo↔lee2021
  random-vs-fixed-horizon contrast surfaced; deterministic-cost caveat carried per `cost-models` flag.

Next: **S4** (regret / convergence) — `regret-gp-bandits`, `ego-convergence-rates`,
`gp-bandit-lower-bounds`; connect srinivas (upper) ↔ scarlett (lower) ↔ bull (EGO rates). Then S5
stubs, S6 integration. Batch handoff: `~/.claude/handoffs/Bayesian-Optimization-2026-06-05-wiki-s3b-done.md`.

**Routing corrections found mid-build** (source-routing.md "primary" column was optimistic):
`frazier2018` covers **only** EI / KG / ES / PES — it has **no** PI, GP-UCB, TS, or standalone
VoI section. PI & TS fell back to `shahriari2016` (taxonomy/default owner); VoI was synthesized
from frazier2018's EI+KG sections + `frazier2009kg`. Expect the same for any note routed
"frazier2018 primary" outside {EI, KG, ES, PES}.
- **S3a:** `xie2025` was routed as `cost-models` secondary but has **no** cost-model content
  (it takes `c(x)` as given) — it is really the `cost-aware-stopping` primary (Pandora's-box/
  PBGI, LogEIPC). Folder is `raw/2025_cost_aware_stopping_bo/` (topic-named, not author —
  `grep -i xie` misses it). Reading it surfaced a 2nd cost-aware *problem formulation*
  (cost-per-sample/cost-adjusted-regret) + LogEIPC/PBGI that the drafted hub+EIpu notes had
  missed → backported. **Lesson saved as auto-memory `feedback_browse-all-sources-before-writing`:
  read (don't grep) all relevant sources before finalizing; do an end-of-build references.md audit.**

**Notation promotions done** (no longer note-local deltas): `μ_n^*` / `μ_n^{**}` (S1a);
`p_⋆`, `γ_T`, `δ` (S1c — promoted mid-pass once shared by ≥3 notes); **cost symbols `c(x)`,
`log c(x)`, `τ`, `τ_init`, `τ_k`, `α_k`, `EIpu`, `EI-cool` (S3a)** — new "Cost-aware BO"
subsection in notation.md; `α_k` flagged as distinct from generic acquisition `α_n(x)`.
Precedent: promote shared symbols when they recur, not deferred to S6. S6 queue currently empty.
